This  project aimed to predict a country's Corruption Perception Index (CPI) using machine learning. Analyzing data from 2012 to 2020 across 196 countries, the study found that legal system & property rights, GNI per capita, and education levels were significant predictors of CPI. 

Three machine learning models were utilized to predict the Corruption Perception Index (CPI), using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R^2) values for accuracy assessment. The models and their corresponding performance metrics are as follows:

**Lasso Regression**
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 77.65
- R-squared (R^2): 0.84
**Decision Tree**
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 93.93
- R-squared (R^2): 0.80
**Random Forest**
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 82.46
- R-squared (R^2): 0.83

Among these models, Lasso Regression performed the best in terms of both the lowest MSE and highest R^2, indicating it was the most accurate model for predicting the Corruption Perception Index in this study, suggesting that improvements in these areas can lead to a reduction in perceived corruption.
